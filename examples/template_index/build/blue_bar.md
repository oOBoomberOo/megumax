Template Pool exposes a special key template called 5 that will get replaced with the index of the generated file.

Due to the generation order, the 5 template will be generated after the program has determined all the possible path variants so you can't use 5 in the file name.

> Note that the program makes no guarantee of the order the file will generate in.
