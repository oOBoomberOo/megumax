# Basic Usage

Megumax's template keys work by replacing the expression block with the value specified in `megu.toml`.

## Expression Block

Expression block is any string of text that is surrounded by square brackets like this "[foo]" but only the keyword specified in `megu.toml` will be replaced when megumax is run.
